        <h3>to do list</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We selected one of the three ideas, "Size-Based Birds Detection", to take shape.</li>
            <li>we watched online lecture about CNN.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Shaping Ideas</h3>
        <p>
            <h4>Using sequence of Images</h4>
            We thought that it was difficult to learn video, By choice of lane, we used a series of images to function like a video.
            So We don't need to use algorithm that detect changes in size of birds.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h4>Just Using the Size-Base Algorithm</h4>
            After detecting birds, make bounding box of bird and measure its size change by following the bird. We just need to focus on changing the bounding box.
            And the most important thing in this idea is real time detecting, so we decide to use YOLO V3 for detecting birds.

        <h3>Coursra CNN Lecture</h3>
        <p>
            We have to learn about
        </p>
            We need to know what the object detection algorithm is and how it works. So we took course in coursera CNN lecture.
