            We decided to proceed with the project on the Camera/Video Animal Detection and Deterrence that Professor Tony explained.
            And decided to come up with our own ideas first, and three ideas came up.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The first idea is that, if a bird is detected,
            the birds captured on the camera are recognized by each individual to know that they are approaching the farm
            and can be detected as the objects grow larger.

        <p>
            The second idea is that when judging a human-like creature,
            it can detect the direction of the creature and determine that it can harm the farm if its direction is directed toward the farm.
            Based on the above three ideas, we are researching and compiling three ideas.

        <p>
            The thrid idea is to help us do it in the evening when we do it through the camera.
            We could simply use a camera with a night vision, but we thought of ways to help detect it in the evening without a night vision as a matter of cost.
            First, it was thought that by installing additional lights near the camera and periodically flashing lights through any trigger,
            detection can be implemented efficiently while solving cost problems.
